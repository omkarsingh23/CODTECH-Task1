Overview of the Project 

Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a simple command-line calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program will take user input, process the calculation, and display the result.

Project Features:
User Input:

The program will prompt the user to enter two numbers.
It will ask the user to choose an arithmetic operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, or Division).
Processing the Calculation:

Based on the user’s choice, the program will perform the selected operation.
It will handle division carefully to avoid errors (e.g., division by zero).
Displaying the Result:

After computing the result, the program will display it clearly.
Error Handling:

It will handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values).
It will prevent division by zero.
Technical Aspects:
Programming Language: Python
User Interaction: input() function
Operations: +, -, *, /
Control Flow: if-elif statements
Error Handling: try-except blocks
Potential Enhancements:
Allow the user to perform multiple calculations in a loop.
Support additional mathematical functions (e.g., exponentiation, modulus).
Provide a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt.
